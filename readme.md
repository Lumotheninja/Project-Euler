# What is Project Euler?
Project Euler is a website that presents Mathematical problems as programming challenges

# Why do you only have solutions up to 100 problems?
I am binding myself to Project Euler's honor code:
> Note: The rule about sharing solutions outside of Project Euler does not apply to the first 100 problems, as long as any discussion clearly aims to instruct methods, not just provide answers, and does not directly threaten to undermine the enjoyment of solving later problems. Problems 1 to 100 provide a wealth of helpful introductory teaching material and if you are able to respect our requirements, then we give permission for them to be discussed elsewhere.

# Why are some solutions missing?
I took a long hiatus before returning to Project Euler. As such, some of the problems I solved previously were missing.

# I do not understand your solution. Can you explain?
You can view my explanations in the website linked in this repo. Don't think that I will explain my solutions to every single problem though.

# Why do you use Python?
I am familiar with Python. And Python really has good libraries for mathematical functions or representing matrices. For example, you can simply do permutations with itertools.

# And Jupyter Notebook?
For the ease of pressing shift + enter to run code blocks.

# What's your Project Euler friend key?
